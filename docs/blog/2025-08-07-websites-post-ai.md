There is a lot of talk about the impact of a post-AI world on the World Wide Web.  It may be, that we have already reached peak-website human traffic, and that the 30 years after the invention of the internet will be known as the human era, but the next 30 will be the AI Agent era.  It seems reasonable to imagine that AI Agents will be the main consumer of website content from now on, and humans will increasingly rely on those AI agents browsing the web on their behalf and bringing back the information to whichever UI they favour, be it a ChatGPT box, a command line tool or something else.

The are various statistics around today that seem to back this up.  Last week, Google released a blog post about the impact of AI Overviews on search web traffic, to mixed reception.  Several SEO's reaction was lamenting that their traffic analytics has been flatlining or dropping recently.  CloudFlare, uniquely positioned to have non-speculative data given they proxy 20% of the web traffic, were so concerned with dropping rates of crawls per vist to their clients website (from ~ 2 crawls per visit 2 years ago to more like 2000 crawls per visit last month) they proposed a new business model completly with its "pay-per-crawl" service, giving a mechanism to charge incrementally for data when requested from data-hungry AI agents.

At the same time, most of the AI-industry thinks that the current UX for interacting with AI is in very early stages, akin to the early skumorphism of the early web.  We are still mostly using APIs, terminals and unstructured text to interact with models, with unstructured text being returned, along with some early moves into other mediums such as images and video.  The biggest winnders so far in the AI revolution have been those that can offer unique UX experiences on top of that, such as the coding tools of Cursor (bringing AI into the most popular code editor, VSCode).  

I propose that these two elements - websites for AI agents and the need for new ways to interact with AI will usher in a new paradigm for website design, for both humans and AI agents.
